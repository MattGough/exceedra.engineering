I've been coding since I was about 12 and in the industry since 2001. I've worked my way through numerous large corporations and consulting firms, finally finding my calling in the world of startups. In that time I've delivered software with most of the common languages and data stores, plus some less common ones too!

At Deliveroo I led the international expansion across most of our countries, set up [Deliveroo for Business](https://deliveroo.co.uk/business/about), and I'm now leading the revamp of our live operations tooling.
