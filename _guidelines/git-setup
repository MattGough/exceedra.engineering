You will be asked to clone the repo, which we will do using Git Bash, but we need the path first and the branch name from the dropdown highlighted.

Navigate to the repo and the branch you want to clone and hit clone to get the URL.

# Bash Git

Navigate explorer to your working repo folder, for me its “C:\Users\CraigHogan\Source\Repos\SalesPlanner (Application) GIT”

Right click on explorer and “Git Bash here”
<!--Note all commands/file names are case sensitive-->![img](file:///C:/Users/CRAIGH~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image015.png)

Make a folder for this branch/repo, named so you have an

idea of what it is for.
`$ mkdir “2.9 E0 unplanned”`

Change to this working folder
`$ cd (then hit TAB until the folder you are looking for is visible)`

Initialise the repo for git

`$ git init`

![img](file:///C:/Users/CRAIGH~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.png)

Add the remote server to the repo

`$ git remote add origin https://exceedrasoftware.visualstudio.com/_git/Sales%20Planner%20(Application)%20GIT`

 

![img](file:///C:/Users/CRAIGH~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image018.png)

In blue you will see it says (master) we don’t want thisbranch, so we need to fetch the branch you want to work with.

`$ git fetch origin "2_9_E0_unplanned"`

You will get the lovely vsonline download screen

![img](file:///C:/Users/CRAIGH~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.png)

If you look in your repo folder there wont be anythingthere, all you have done is fetched the branch and stored it in your own gitdatabase.

To get the files you need to check them out

`$ git checkout "2_9_E0_unplanned"`

![img](file:///C:/Users/CRAIGH~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image020.png)

Note the branch in blue has switched as you are now activelyconnected to this local branch.

Open the solution in visual studio to do the fun stuff, the Git Bash Gui is a great place to do your checkins (commits) to your local and remote branches

 

##  Need a new branch

If you are starting work on a new feature, click on “New Branch” and create one based on the current version master.
The new branch name must be structured like:  

`[Major]_[Minor]_E[enhancement]_[feature Name]`
