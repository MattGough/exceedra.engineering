It’s time to take a look back at the last few months or so and see what was good/bad/ugly to hopefully give us some ideas on how we can better at what we do for the next period.
This isn’t just a company/team retrospective, it’s a good time for you guys to look back on what you have done/learnt and what you can do on a personal level to better at what you do.

This website has a good outline of what we are going to do during these retrospective meetings, which will take place the day we start the next version - http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-retrospective and to summarise:

Each member of the team will need to answer the following questions to the rest of the team:

-	Who helped me or us or did something quite cool?
-	What worked well for us/me?
-	What did not work well for us/me?
-	What actions can we/I take to improve our process going forward?

There is no right or wrong way answer/comment at a retrospective, the idea is to make sure that if you think something is not working that you let the team know, don’t be shy.

When we leave the retrospective, everyone needs to take away:
-	What do I need to do now?
-	How can I improve my (or team members) skills/knowledge?
-	Who do I need to spend time with to get better at what I do?
-	Should we do this sort of retrospective again why/why not?
