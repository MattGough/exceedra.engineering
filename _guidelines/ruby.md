## About the style guide

This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it
is.

This guide is largely based upon Bozhidar Batsovâ€™s 
[Ruby Style Guide][ruby-style-guide], based on feedback and suggestions from 
members of the Ruby community and various highly regarded Ruby programming 
resources, such as Programming Ruby 1.9[^programming-ruby] and 
The Ruby Programming Language[^the-ruby-programming-language].
