I hail from sunny Italy to bring my culinary and coding skills to the Engineering team at Deliveroo. 

Since I decided to make a career in tech I've worked in corporate, web agencies and have gone through the mandatory contracting period. I'm currently enjoying the startup scene because I like bringing ideas to life and iterating fast.

Despite rumours to the contrary, I am not, in fact, Batman.
