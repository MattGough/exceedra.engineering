I've been a full-time "Person Who Builds Things With Code" since 2008 in my hometown of Sydney, back when the Frontend simply meant spending more time writing HTML, JavaScript and CSS - as opposed to, you know, setting up a linter for my build tool's configuration file to ensure my modules are bundled and my transpiler can run and... *fades off into a web-shaped abyss*.

Eventually, I crossed over to the server-side where I did S-finger-shaped gang signs and built things with PHP, ColdFusion and my current friend, Ruby. I still think the client-side is kind of cool and am slowly trying to make friends with it again.

In my spare time I enjoy and teach a social dance called [Brazilian Zouk](http://zouktheworld.com/brazilianzouk/), and am on the board over at the wonderful open source communities, [WHFNP](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/) and [EmpowerHack](http://empowerhack.io/).
