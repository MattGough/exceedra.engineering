<h1>Build things at Deliveroo</h1>
<p class="tagline">Only awesome code.</p>

<section id="careers" class="listings-loading">
  <p class="introduction">We’re a world-beating engineering company in the heart of London. We were started in Europe and we’re building a world class engineering team in Europe. We’re looking for outstanding engineers to join our team and work with us on some of the hardest problems around. Here’s why Deliveroo is a great place for you.</p>

  <h3>Global impact</h3>
  <p>Deliveroo is one of the fastest growing start-ups in European history, with a truly global reach. We operate in 12 countries and counting. Our riders can be seen on the streets in over a hundred major cities. We keep our customers all over the world fed around the clock. It's a great feeling to work on software and literally get to eat the results!</p>

  <h3>Unique challenges</h3>
  <p>We’re growing rapidly in a new and highly competitive space, solving problems which only a few companies are successful enough to have. We push the limits of modern computer science and learn new things every day. How do we scale our architecture as we grow? How do we build the most efficient tools to ensure we get great food to our customers quickly? We’re assembling an incredible team to tackle these and other unique problems.</p>

  <h3>Modern tools, modern practices</h3>
  <p>You’ll work within a multidisciplinary, data-driven product team using agile methodologies to deliver well-tested, peer-reviewed code rapidly into production via continuous deployment. We make use of A/B testing, feature switching and other modern tools to roll out and monitor the performance and reliability of our changes.</p>

  <h3>Enjoy the ride</h3>
  <p>We’re moving incredibly fast but there’s no reason why the ride can’t also be fun and rewarding!  Company culture is very important to us and we work hard to cultivate an environment that everyone can thrive in.  Participate in the <em>Bunday Monday</em> bake-off, join <em>Ride Together</em> delivering food in Central London, or maybe present to the team all-hands on a topic you love. We also support conference attendance, and run regular off-sites and social events so you can really get to know your team.</p>
      
  <p>And well, we’re Deliveroo, so there’s food.  Oh <em>yes</em>, there is food…</p>

  <h2>We’re hiring!</h2>
