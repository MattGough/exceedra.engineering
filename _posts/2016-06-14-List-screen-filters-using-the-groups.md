  How to split the visible filter items up over groups 

---

  <p>On the user settings screen there is a tab for managing user groups, which in essence a re sub set of the listings data. Users can have as many groups as they need for each list screen n the app.</p>

<p>All we are allowing a user to do is limit what they can "see" in any group. If for example they are in charge of multiple geographic areas they could create a group for each that only displays the relevant listings</p>
<p>For example in the screenshot above, I have decided to create a new group for all soda SKUs except for Morrisons as someone else manages these for them.</p>
<p>When I look at the promotions list screen I can only see the items I have selected to be visible in that group</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My defaults sit on top of this, so I could deselect and save my defaults as normal, but these deafults are saved against the grouping for this screen</p>
<p>Promotions using same group (different defaults)</p>

<p>Claims, same group but different defaults</p>
