<h4><a name="Promotions-ROBs-Conditions-Scenarios-Schedule-and-Funds-List-Screens"></a>Promotions, ROBs, Conditions, Scenarios, Schedule and Funds List Screens</h4>
<p>In the Promotions, ROBs, Conditions, Scenarios, Schedule and Funds
list screens the listings control will hide any products which are not
listed for any selected customers at any point during the selected date
range.
If a product is listed for some but not all customers then the product
will be shown but it's name will be appear in blue rather than black. </p>
<h4><a name="Claims-List-Screen"></a>Claims List Screen</h4>
<p>The Claims list screen behaves the same as the Promotions, ROBs,
Scenarios and Funds list screens except that the listings control will
use either the claim start date or the event start date, depending on
which is earlier, to calculate delistings.</p>
<h3><a name="Editor-Screens"></a>Editor Screens</h3>
<h4><a name="Promotions-Wizard"></a>Promotions Wizard</h4>
<p>After setting the Buy-in Dates on the Dates screen the data base
updates what products are delisted. Delisted products are then hidden
from the user on the Products screen.</p>
<h4><a name="Funds-Editor-and-ROBs-Single-Editor"></a>Funds Editor and ROBs (Single) Editor</h4>
<p>When selecting a start date if a product delists before that date for
all selected customers then the product will not appear in the product
drop down. If the product is available for one or more selected
customers then the products will appear in the product drop down. </p>
<h4><a name="ROBs-Group-Editor-and-Contracts"></a>ROBs Group Editor and Contracts</h4>
<p>Products are removed from the products tree when the start date in
the Properties vertical grid is set to after the products delisting date
for all currently selected customers. </p>
