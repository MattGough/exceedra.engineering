  The vertical grid control uses a set of templates to allow us to display a list of controls so that we can work with any data we need it to. The control is built up of a number of individual controls displayed as a vertical list. Data must conform to the XML structure mentioned below, any inconsistencies will be ignored or could crash the grid completely.
